# Hi, I'm Anthony 👋

### 🚀 Aspiring DevSecOps Engineer & AI Builder
Based in Nigeria 🇳🇬 | | Linux Enthusiast (Parrot OS)

I am a developer focused on the intersection of **Security**, **Infrastructure**, and **AI Agents**. My goal is to bridge the gap between complex code and efficient workflows. I specialize in **AI-Assisted Development**, architecting environments that leverage LLMs to ship full-stack projects faster and more securely. Beyond the code, I am passionate about the structural side of tech, including **Business Development** and **GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)**, ensuring that what I build is not just functional, but secure and well-managed.
